This is the main repository for the *Thermally Sensitive ECOSTRESS Evapotranspiration Model Ensemble Evaluation and Development* project for NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES).

### Abstract

This repository hosts a unique software designed for scientific research, specifically focusing on the field of evapotranspiration remote sensing models. The software aims to address the critical need for evapotranspiration models that can accurately respond to changes in surface temperature observed at fine spatial resolution and frequent temporal resolution.

The distinguishing feature of this software is its ability to measure the error propagation of remotely sensed input variables to all major variables estimated in evapotranspiration modeling, including net radiation and soil heat flux. This capability fills a significant gap in the field as there appears to be no publicly available code that offers similar functionality.

The development and release of this software aligns with the SPD-41 open-science requirement of NASA-funded research. It is part of the Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) project “Thermally Sensitive ECOSTRESS Evapotranspiration”. This research effort is aimed at optimizing the evapotranspiration remote sensing capabilities of the Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) and Surface Biology and Geology missions.

This software is primarily intended for scientific research as a valuable tool in the study of evapotranspiration models. The software is written in Python, making it accessible and easy to use for researchers familiar with the language.

This software stands as a pioneering tool in the field of evapotranspiration modeling, offering unique capabilities for measuring error propagation and contributing to the advancement of remote sensing research.
